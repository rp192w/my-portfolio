# My Portfolio

Week 2: Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote HTML and CSS for a professional portfolio to showcase my work for potential employers. I have used what I have learned in the first 2 weeks of the bootcamp as well as other youtube tutorials while keeping in mind the following requirements for the challenge:

I present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
The links in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
The link to the section about my work the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the applications.
My first application's image is larger in size than the others.
When someone clicks on the image of an application they are taken to that deployed application.
When someone resizes the page or view the site on various screens and devices the page is responsive and adapts.

Note: For my first application I followed the following youtube course to make the youtube-clone project.

While the code is the same as the youtuber's, I wrote it all myself as I followed along and it did teach and reinforce what I learned in the bootcamp.
